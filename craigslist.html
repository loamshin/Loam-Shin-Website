      		<h2> Craigslist Redesign</h2>
	  		<h3>THE BRIEF:</h3>
	  			<p>Craigslist is one of the most used classified advertisement websites that are designed to help users in buying and selling products. Just only that, but it also allows users to search for jobs and connect with others through discussion forums and services.

			<div>Goal:<p>Craigslist is one of the most controversial web designs, and it has been used and redesigned by many designers. While other well-known websites keep updating their UX/UI, Craigslist has not changed much from day one. It is resistant to any change, but it still works surprisingly. Its simple design allows anyone to use it without explanation, assistance, or feeling defeated. It keeps the focus on the tasks such as buying and selling.
Because it has achieved its purpose, I decided that I kept the iconic elements, but gave it an upgrade on the layout.
The goal of this process was to focus on improving its visual design, usability, and organization.

        <h3>PERSONAL RESEARCH:</h3>
            <p>
To get started, I wanted to get some initial insight into how users may use this platform so that I could understand the functions better. While I was looking around, there was one prominent part that I could break it down into a few main things such as.
                &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <div class = "list">
                <ul>
<li>Buying and selling things (clothing, furniture, electronics, housing, etc)</li>
<li>Conducting business (job search, advertising, etc)</li>
<li>Connecting with others (discussion forums, activities, volunteering, etc)</li>
                    </ul>
            </div>

        <h3>DESIGN NOTES:</h3>
        <div><img src="assets/images/craigslistnotes.png"></div>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    
    <div>
        <h3>WIREFRAMES:</h3>
        <P>
        I created three different general layouts. While keeping Craigslist's brand identity in mind, I knew that I had to keep the categorial lists. However, in the first wireframe, I was playing around with photos for an easy identifier and access. In the second and last wireframes, I decided to go back and keep the lists but shortened the margins between lists.</P>
        
        <h4>Original features to keep:</h4>
        <div class = "list">
        <ul>
            <li>Categorial lists</li>
            <li>Logo</li>
            <li>Calendar</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
    
        <h4>Features to change:</h4>
        <div class = "list">
        <ul>
            <li>aesthetics/color pleasant to the eyes.</li>
            <li>calendar features</li>
            <li>search bar</li>
            <li>compact design by placing a sidebar in the footer</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
        
        <div><img src="assets/images/craigslistwireframe.png"></div>
    
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <div>
        <h3>FINAL DESIGN:</h3>
        <div><img src="assets/images/craigslistfinalwebsite.png"></div>
        <p>For the final design, I made some changes that are visibly different from the original Craigslist.<br><br>
<b>Pleasant to the eyes.</b><br>
            
Aesthetics can influence the overall experience of a website. The original website had little to no use of color. While keeping the iconic color of blue, I decided to use a color palette with blues, the website becomes more visually appealing. I also added boxes along the side to create contrast which improves the readability.<br><br>
<b>Calendar features.</b><br>
On the original website, the calendar is not labeled which does not provide clarity for the user. I added a month and year as well as arrows that the user can see both previous and future months.<br><br>
            <b>Search bar.</b><br>
I believe having a search bar on top of a webpage is an important feature. For those users who can find what they want or need through a simple search without having to look around the website and possibly giving up at the end. I added the distance and the name of city/zip code to enhance usability. <br><br>
            <b>Compact design by placing a sidebar in the footer.</b><br>
I found myself looking all over the webpage just to find something that I need. To make it more compact and simple, I decided to put the miscellaneous yet important information such as help or about in the footer. </p>
