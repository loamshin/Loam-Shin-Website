            <p>
              95% of deaf children are born to hearing parents and most of them do
              not know sign language. No early exposure to sign language prevents
              deaf children from receiving accessible language input. Having no
              foundation from an early age reduces the chance of building creative
              thinking, better problem solving skills, greater academic achievement,
              etc. </p>
              
              <h2>Goal:</h2>
            <p>
              Our goal was to create a application for deaf children with hearing parents.
              To improve communication between parents and their deaf children, 
              we sought a solution that will integrate the 
              gameplay experience with sign language. 
              It would have features that motivate children to learn 
              and enjoy the playing experience. Not just learning, 
              children will have an opportunity to take on a leadership 
              role as they teach their parent sign language.

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>
            Before we got into research, we knew we wanted to do something with 
            accessiblity for deaf children. Since we have witnessed communication
            barriers that deaf children faced with their hearing parents, we wanted
            to take further research into educational games that most children benefit. 
            Based on our findings, there were not that many games that use
            American Sign Language (ASL). We began to explore educational games that most
            children would use at home or school. As we explored, we found that many apps
            did not offer any languages other than English. We noticed those apps were not
            accessible for children with their parents who speak other languages. So 
            from there, we want to create something that provides full access for deaf children.
            That includes providing ASL video clips or any ASL centric content.

        <h3>User testing</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Task flow 1:</b> Answering onboarding questions.
            <br>
            After creating an account, user was asked to answer
            these questions so that the data will be sorted based
            on their preferences.

            <br><br>
            <b>Task flow 2:</b> Passing all levels in the ABC category.
            <br>
            User was asked to pass all levels before moving on to the
            next level. This part would ask user to copy signs that were
            shown in video clips.
        </p>


        <h3>Lo-Fi Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            The goal for our testing was to get feedback on our user interface. 
            Whenever they became confused or hesitant to do a task, 
            we asked questions such as “what do you think you should do next?”, 
            “what do you think will happen next if you press X?” etc. 
            We carefully documented the breakdowns of each user while interacting 
            with the prototypes.
            <br><br>
            From the testing, we found many flaws in our app which led users 
            not to understand what they were supposed to do throughout the test.
            <br><br>
            <b>Task flow 1:</b> The biggest issue we found was that they asked if
            they should set up for themselves or a child. Another one was that they 
            wanted to be able to customize time pace.
            <br><br>
            <b>Task flow 2:</b> When they were on a category page, they expected
            feedback indicated to them not to click something that was locked or disabled.
            Another big issue was that they were not sure if they signed right or not
            there was no feedback.

            <h2>High Fidelity</h2>
            <p>As we transitioned our paper lo-fi prototype to a prototye so that 
                we could add interactive features for our users. Therefore, this
                hi-fi prototype was designed on the computer using Figma, as it
                allows for more flexiblity when we need to update the important
                features or make any revisions to our designs.<br><br>
                Since we received feedback on user tasks from our lo-fi prototype, we had to
                make a lot of revisions including removing some tasks
                to our hi-fi prototype. After testing, we decided to remove some unecesssary tasks
                to simplify the overall experience. We realized that our previous tasks
                caused stress in users. The only two tasks we used for this hi-fi prototype
                analysis: (1) log in and (2) navigation to the game category. Based on our 
                testing, we felt these particular tasks were the source to solution to
                the task flows. We anticipated that these would help us pinpoint the task flow
                obstacle.
                <br><br>

                The purpose of this was to build relationship with users and allow them to make
                customizations to their preferences.

                    <li>
                        Enter your username, password, and phone number: if user already
                        had an account, they would click "have an account?" phone number
                        was for a parent, so they could get a code once the user completed
                        a level and wanted to collaborate.

                    <li>
                        Daily goal: once they click "create account", they would be 
                        prompted to select which time that fits them best.

                        Allow notifications: push notifications alert users to get 
                        in real-time from an app. They would have to opt for alerts
                        getting daily reminders and when new games come in.

                    The purpose of this was to make sure users feel comfortable
                    and ready before jumping in the real game. This would teach
                    users how to play the game especially when it had sign
                    recognition which may be new to many.

                    This is when users got to play the actual games. The game process
                    was similar to the tutorial part, but it did not include instructions.
                    In this part, we included a reward system (rewarding indicator and level completed)
                    and visual map of levels.

                Our initial audience would be deaf children. But since we are college
                students with no transportation and were not able to see children off
                campus, we recruited 10 other college students who were friends or acquainted
                with us. Before we started usability tests, we explained this application and 
                its goal to the participants. We emphasized that this was a prototype with 
                interactive features, not an actual application. After having them doing
                tasks, we asked them to complete the rating. We used the ratings to generate
                severity ratings to measure the overall satisfaction experience with the interface 
                and application itself.

            <h3>Hi-Fi Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                The observed results varied based on how the participants got confused
                by the instruction, picking unlocked categories, and signing the right
                word. 75% of participants clicked the locked button even though it was 
                darker than the unlocked button. For the log in, all the participants
                seemed to understand what to do when logging in/creating an account. 
                Overall, the majority of participants enjoyed the concept and thought
                it was a good idea to have an application to help hearing parents and
                deaf children improve their relationship with each other.
                <br><br>
                <h3>Possible enhancements:</h3>
                Based on feedback, there were some issues that participants experienced
                and we followed up with some possible solutions.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span style="color:red"><i>Issue: </i></span> When signed in, the participant did not understand
                        the purpose of having a daily goal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span style="color:green"><i>Solution 1:</i></span> Add "information" with an icon indicating to users 
                        that it is for more information about a daily goal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span style="color:green"><i>Solution 2:</i></span> Possibly delete this task from the user flow 
                        since it is not necessary for users to customize their pace
                        preferences until they make changes through settings.
                    </li>

                    <br><br>

                    <li>
                      <span style="color:red"><i>Issue:</i></span> The border color was too thin and hard to see 
                        (incorrect/correct). The background color 
                        (i.e., didn't work well with the thin border) 
                        might have made it harder for users to see.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span style="color:green"><i>Solution 1:</i></span> Need to add more weight to the border.

            In summary, we were able to take away valuable information
            regarding the design and the interface itself. From the testing,
            we were able to introduce our champs! application to the participants.
            Unexpectedly, we were able to collect all of the participants' opinions,
            feedback, and comments. The results from usability testing showed that 
            there were some particular tasks the majority of the participants found 
            confusing. We also learned that this application was not as intuitive as 
            we thought it would be. If given the opportunity and more time, we would 
            conduct more intensive testing and gather data to help us pinpoint and 
            tackle the problems that we faced recently.
