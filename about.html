			<p>I am a UX/UI Developer based in Rochester, NY. 
            I love to create experiences that are built for everyone to use. I've always loved art, and technology eventually became a big part of my life.
    As my interest in the digital world has continued to grow, I became interested in integrating design into front-end development.<br><br>
	In my free time, I enjoy baking and trying new recipes. Since I am a perfectionist, I find accurate baking
	measurements very satisfying. I'm always on the lookout for the best dessert whenever I visit a new city.
	I also love hiking and walking with my dog on the weekends.
