      		<h2> PopSign</h2>
<!--	  		<h3>THE BRIEF:</h3>-->
	  			<p>PopSign is a mobile game application that teaches hearing parents of deaf babies 
                      American Sign Language. 95% of deaf children are born to hearing parents who 
                      do not know sign language. Those deaf children are at risk of limited access 
                      to language early in life because they can’t hear spoken language and their 
                      parents do not know how to communicate. While there are no apps that use 
                      gamification to teach ASL, PopSign has been developed to create an easy way 
                      for parents to acquire sign language words and provide a solid foundation for 
                      their deaf infants to succeed in life.

			<div>Goal:<p>During beta testing, the CAT team set out to improve the app, troubleshoot bugs, 
                and gather user feedback to continue developing upon the release. User studies were 
                conducted to gather feedback and to assess the effectiveness of PopSign. To create 
                several iterations, the design was set up in Figma to easily apply changes throughout 
                the process and to keep the gameplay consistent. Wireframes were also created to showcase 
                additional features including game tutorials and scoring mechanics that integrate UI elements.

        <h3>PROBLEM:</h3>
            <p>
After several version of PopSign was released, user feedback has been gathered. 
One most common problem that appeared in those user tests, adults of deaf children often 
had a hard time understanding the gameplay and eventually stopped playing. The game app 
also had UI issues that needed to be worked through.

        <h3>THE DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
        <p>To improve the overall user experience, the evaluation of usability 
            and the app’s features has been conducted. I was assigned a task to 
            implement game tutorials that can enhance the player experience and 
            improve their understanding of gameplay. This process included user 
            studies that tested participants’ understanding of gameplay and scoring 
            and asked them about the game's functionality.<br><br>
After conducting those user tests, the results provided useful insights 
into possible solutions. The concern that PopSign showed was the lack of game flow. 
To those first-time players who are not familiar with this gameplay, this current 
version that does not contain instructions cause more confusion in how to shoot the 
bubbles or understand the scoring mechanics. Participants also found the game confusing 
as they expected feedback after shooting the bubbles. The second major finding was that 
participants were frustrated with UI elements including the color palette and confusing buttons.

        <h3>WIREFRAMES/PROTOTYPES:</h3>
        <p>
<b>Game tutorials:</b><br>
Introduce new content by adding detailed game tutorials to help first-time players 
understand PopSign’s gameplay and scoring mechanics. These tutorials, consisting 
of several ways to shoot the bubbles: drag to aim, bounce off the wall, and swap 
the bubbles, are set at the beginning of gameplay seamlessly. <br><br>
            
<b>Redesigning UI aspects to improve the user experience:</b><br>
            <b>Color palette:</b> the choice of color matters when it comes to creating 
            an accessible application. Including accessible hues in this design, the specific palette 
            makes the game more usable and enjoyable to people who may have disabilities 
            like color-blindness or vision impairment.<br>
            <b>Visual feedback:</b> a feature of user interaction is important when it 
            comes to how information is given back to the users. As the players expect 
            something in return after shooting the bubbles, 
            visual feedback is a good way to let users know that they earn points.

        <h3>CONCLUSION:</h3>
<!--        <div><img src="assets/images/craigslistfinalwebsite.png"></div>-->
        <p>Since PopSign is still in development, the work has provided a 
            foundation for it to create another game design. With my contribution 
            to the team, PopSign will be able to provide a better user experience. 
            New features outlined in the wireframes and user tests during my time 
            with the CAT team will improve usability and functionality 
            and possibly pave a way for new games.<br><br></p>
<!--
<b>Pleasant to the eyes.</b><br>
            
Aesthetics can influence the overall experience of a website. The original website had little to no use of color. While keeping the iconic color of blue, I decided to use a color palette with blues, the website becomes more visually appealing. I also added boxes along the side to create contrast which improves the readability.<br><br>
<b>Calendar features.</b><br>
On the original website, the calendar is not labeled which does not provide clarity for the user. I added a month and year as well as arrows that the user can see both previous and future months.<br><br>
            <b>Search bar.</b><br>
I believe having a search bar on top of a webpage is an important feature. For those users who can find what they want or need through a simple search without having to look around the website and possibly giving up at the end. I added the distance and the name of city/zip code to enhance usability. <br><br>
            <b>Compact design by placing a sidebar in the footer.</b><br>
I found myself looking all over the webpage just to find something that I need. To make it more compact and simple, I decided to put the miscellaneous yet important information such as help or about in the footer. </p>
