        <h2>PopSign</h2>
        <p>PopSign is a mobile game application that teaches hearing parents of deaf babies 
            American Sign Language. 95% of deaf children are born to hearing parents who 
            do not know sign language. Those deaf children are at risk of limited access 
            to language early in life because they can’t hear spoken language and their 
            parents do not know how to communicate. While there are no apps that use 
            gamification to teach ASL, PopSign has been developed to create an easy way 
            for parents to acquire sign language words and provide a solid foundation for 
            their deaf infants to succeed in life.

        <h2>Goal:</h2>
        <p>During beta testing, the CAT team set out to improve the app, troubleshoot bugs, 
            and gather user feedback to continue developing upon the release. User studies were 
            conducted to gather feedback and to assess the effectiveness of PopSign. To create 
            several iterations, the design was set up in Figma to easily apply changes throughout 
            the process and to keep the gameplay consistent. Wireframes were also created to showcase 
            additional features including game tutorials and scoring mechanics that integrate UI elements.

    <div class="process">
        <h2>Design Process</h2>

            <p>What is the problem? After several version of PopSign was released, user feedback has been gathered. 
                One most common problem that appeared in those user tests, adults of deaf children often 
                had a hard time understanding the gameplay and eventually stopped playing. The game app 
                also had UI issues that needed to be worked through.</p>


                <p>To improve the overall user experience, the evaluation of usability 
                    and the app’s features has been conducted. I was assigned a task to 
                    implement game tutorials that can enhance the player experience and 
                    improve their understanding of gameplay. This process included user 
                    studies that tested participants’ understanding of gameplay and scoring 
                    and asked them about the game's functionality.<br><br>
                    After conducting those user tests, the results provided useful insights 
                    into possible solutions. The concern that PopSign showed was the lack of game flow. 
                    To those first-time players who are not familiar with this gameplay, this current 
                    version that does not contain instructions cause more confusion in how to shoot the 
                    bubbles or understand the scoring mechanics. Participants also found the game confusing 
                    as they expected feedback after shooting the bubbles. The second major finding was that 
                    participants were frustrated with UI elements including the color palette and confusing buttons.
                    </p>



                    <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
                    <p>
            <b>Game tutorials:</b><br>
            Introduce new content by adding detailed game tutorials to help first-time players 
            understand PopSign’s gameplay and scoring mechanics. These tutorials, consisting 
            of several ways to shoot the bubbles: drag to aim, bounce off the wall, and swap 
            the bubbles, are set at the beginning of gameplay seamlessly. <br><br>
                        
            <b>Redesigning UI aspects to improve the user experience:</b><br>
                        <b>Color palette:</b> the choice of color matters when it comes to creating 
                        an accessible application. Including accessible hues in this design, the specific palette 
                        makes the game more usable and enjoyable to people who may have disabilities 
                        like color-blindness or vision impairment.<br>
                        <b>Visual feedback:</b> a feature of user interaction is important when it 
                        comes to how information is given back to the users. As the players expect 
                        something in return after shooting the bubbles, 
                        visual feedback is a good way to let users know that they earn points.

    <div class="takeaway">
        <h2>My takeaway</h2>
        <p>Since PopSign is still in development, the work has provided a 
            foundation for it to create another game design. With my contribution 
            to the team, PopSign will be able to provide a better user experience. 
            New features outlined in the wireframes and user tests during my time 
            with the CAT team will improve usability and functionality 
            and possibly pave a way for new games.<br><br></p>
